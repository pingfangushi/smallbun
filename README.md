  1. we provided a [code formatter file](./Formatter.xml), it will formatting
  automatically your project when during process of building.
  
  2. Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment
  with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a
  paragraph on what the class is for.
  
  3. Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project)
  
  4. Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
  
  5. Add some Javadocs.
  
  6. A few unit tests would help a lot as well — someone has to do it.
  
  7. When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), if
  you are fixing an existing issue please add Fixes gh-XXXX at the end
  of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).
